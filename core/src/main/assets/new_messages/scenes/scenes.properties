scenes.changesscene.rpd_prefix=EPD is forked from RPD v3.40.0-FINAL. All changes documented in the repository should be correct, unless superseded by EPD changes.\n\nOriginal message from _Hoto-Mocha (Cocoa)_:
scenes.changesscene.rpd_changes=The game is still incomplete, has a short update cycle, and may have frequent changes that are the same or similar, so it's inefficient to mark them down in the game, so I don't put the changes in the game.\n\nDetails of changes can be found in the Github release by version.
scenes.changesscene.spd_prefix=EPD was rebased to SPD v3.3.0. All changes below should be correct, unless superseded by EPD changes.
