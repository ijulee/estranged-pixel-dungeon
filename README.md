# Estranged Pixel Dungeon
**Estranged Pixel Dungeon** serves as a continuation of
[ReARanged Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/Hoto-Mocha/Re-ARranged-Pixel-Dungeon/) (RAPD) by
[Hoto-Mocha (Cocoa)](https://github.com/Hoto-Mocha/), which is basically an add-on mod of
[Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) (SPD) by [Evan Debenham](https://github.com/00-Evan) and has been
made with its open source under the GPLv3 license.

[Github Releases](https://github.com/ijulee/estranged-pixel-dungeon/releases)

This game is fully supported in English. Some Korean, Russian, and Simplified Chinese text comes
from RAPD, and all other language texts come from SPD. Currently there are no plans to translate
text added in this mod.

## What is added?
I was sad to hear that Hoto-Mocha (Cocoa) will not continue developing Re-Arranged due to personal 
issues. It's clear that there was still a lot of content waiting to be fleshed out and refined. 
That's what I wish to do with EstRanged. At the same time, I will keep this mod up-to-date with 
Shattered releases as well. I'll try to implement more interesting changes over time.
